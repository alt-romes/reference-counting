----- Signature functions -----

-- | Create an alias for a resource.
newAlias :: MonadIO m
    => (a ⊸ μ ()) -- ^ Function to free resource when the last alias is released
     ⊸ a          -- ^ The resource to alias
     ⊸ m (Alias μ a)
newAlias freeC x = Linear.do
  Ur c <- liftSystemIOU $ Counter.new 1
  pure $ Alias freeC c x


-- | This function returns a value that is aliased in a linear pair with a
-- function to free the linear value. Since both the value and freeing function
-- must be consumed linearly, it is guaranteed that the returned function is
-- the one used to free the resource.
--
-- The cleanup function can be one of two things:
--
-- * If the returned value was the last reference, the function is the one
-- passed as an argument to 'new'
--
-- * Otherwise, if this isn't the last reference to the value, the freeing
-- function will be a no-op, but still must be called on the value.
--
-- Usage:
--
-- @
-- (x, cleanup) <- Aliasable.get ref
-- x' <- useSomehow x
-- cleanup x'
-- @
get :: MonadIO μ => Alias μ a ⊸ μ (a, a ⊸ μ ())
-- Note on unsafety: If some (sub-)resource is unsafely duplicated from the
-- returned @a@, it's crucial that if @a@ is freed manually, it cannot be
-- passed on to the resource-freeing-function! If you don't mess with unsafety
-- this shouldn't be possible. (This is kind of a moot comment since it must be
-- considered in each case carefully).
get (Alias freeC counter x) = Linear.do
  -- The freeing function, in consuming @x@ linearly, is guaranteed to also
  -- free/forget recursively nested reference-counted resources. That's why we
  -- don't need to (here) additionally call the freeing action in recursively
  -- nested aliases, as it's guaranteed by linearity to happen in @freeC@.
  --
  -- That is also why we decrement the counter directly instead of using @'Unsafe.Alias.dec'@,
  -- since the latter would recursively decrement all reference counted
  -- aliases, which would be disastrous when the user defined functions
  -- decremented said sub-aliases manually.

-- In that sense I suppose it is unsafe? If we call unsafeDup, then forget, but don't force the result of unsafeDup, forget will actually forget the result instead of having been incremented?
